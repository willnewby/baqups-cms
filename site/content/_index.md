blurb:
  heading: Why Baqups?
  text: >
    Baqups is painless backups for Kubernetes Clusters. All your configuration,
    all your data. You could run opensource tooling, but then you'd have to
    construct monitoring around that, and test restores.
intro:
  heading: What we offer
  text: >-
    Automatic backup + validation for kubernetes clusters. No more custom
    solutions that break and donâ€™t work when you need them the most.
products:

    text: >-
      Set the frequency & install the daemon, we do the rest.

      No mucking about with bucket policies, IAM or custom scripts. Sane
      defaults all the way. 
  - image: /img/Validation.svg
    text: >-
      Every backup is automatically validated by setting up and tearing down a
      new cluster. Your backups will always be there when you need them.
values:
  heading: Our values
  text: >-
    Backups are mission-critical infrastrure and they're not really backups
    unless you've verified them. We're on a mission to verify every backup, so
    no one is ever left in a disaster scenario without the tools they need.
